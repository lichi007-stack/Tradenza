## About

Tradenza is an open-source trading journal I originally built for my own trading. After living in it for a while, I decided to release it to the community — free to use, free to self-host, and open to contributions.

It is designed for traders who want to improve through data rather than feelings: log every trade, review the chart and your execution, track the statistics that actually matter, and hold yourself accountable — both to your trading rules and to the everyday habits that decide how you show up.

> **Two ways to use Tradenza:** use the hosted version at **[tradenza.dev](https://tradenza.dev)** — sign up and start journaling, no setup required — or self-host your own instance with Docker (see [Self-hosting](#self-hosting-docker)) or locally (see [Quick start](#quick-start)). Both run the same open-source code, and it's free either way.

> **Status:** Active development by a solo maintainer. The app is feature-rich and used daily, but it is pre-1.0 — expect rough edges and breaking changes. Issues and pull requests are very welcome.

## Highlights

- **Customizable dashboard** — drag-and-drop widget grid (powered by dnd-kit) with savable layout templates. KPI tiles (net P&L, trade/day win rate, profit factor, expectancy, average R:R, average win/loss, max drawdown, current streak…) plus larger widgets: a trade score radar, cumulative P&L curve, net daily P&L, a P&L calendar, top symbols, an adherence panel (the three blocks plus your review queue), and performance broken down by entry time and trade duration.
- **Rich trade journal** — per-trade detail with an interactive price chart marking your entries and exits (futures, stocks, forex and crypto — see [Market data & charts](#market-data--charts) for setup and the options/CFD limitation), multi-execution / multi-leg editor, running P&L, star rating, and structured notes (setup, emotions before/after, mistakes, lessons). The detail sidebar is fully customizable — show, hide and drag-to-reorder every panel and stat row to build your own review layout, saved to your account.
- **Strategies & playbooks** — define each setup you trade as a reusable strategy with reference screenshots and a color. Assign a strategy to a trade, then measure how faithfully you followed the plan in three separate blocks — the universal gate (were you allowed to take it), the setup read (did the chart really show it), and the exit execution. Criteria have stable identities and effective dates, so rewording one doesn't erase the sample behind it. A trade follows the live checklist for 24 hours after you record it — so criteria written today apply to what you log today, backtests included — and then locks, because a checklist you can fill in months later measures memory rather than decisions. A block only counts once you confirm you've reviewed it, so "never looked at" never masquerades as "total indiscipline" — and the trades still waiting on a review are one click away from the trades list, the day review and the dashboard. Retired setups can be archived without losing their trade history.
- **Deep statistics** — win rate (overall, longs, shorts), profit factor, expectancy, planned vs. realized R-multiples, MAE/MFE excursions, net ROI, breakeven levels, hold-time analysis, consecutive win/loss streaks, day-level stats, fees/commissions breakdown, and more.
- **Discipline tracking** — hold yourself to your own rules, separate from P&L, across two tabs: **Trading** rules and **Daily** habits. Every rule is either a _task_ you tick off (scored by how many you keep) or a _constraint_ you must not break — and a breach costs what it should: a trading limit reddens the day on the first breach, a daily habit follows _never miss twice_. Each rule runs on its own weekday schedule. Every day is graded green / amber / red on a year-long heatmap, with clean-day streaks, a 30-day trend, per-rule and per-weekday consistency, daily reviews you can back-fill without a deadline, days you mark as not counted (holiday, illness — per domain or the whole day), and a "does discipline pay off?" breakdown of average daily P&L and R-multiple by day type. Every change is **forward-only**: pausing, archiving or moving a rule's schedule applies from today and never re-scores a day you already lived through.
- **Trading accounts** — built around the prop-firm workflow (firm, phase, account size, starting balance, currency). Assign trades to accounts and filter everything by account.
- **Universal CSV import & export** — a guided wizard imports any CSV/TXT export: it auto-detects the columns from your file's headers and shows you the mapping so you can correct any of it before importing, which means a broker doesn't need a bespoke parser to work. A picker of 25 known brokers, prop firms and platforms (Interactive Brokers, MetaTrader 4/5, Tradovate, TopstepX, Thinkorswim, cTrader, Rithmic, DeepCharts, …) pre-sets the right asset class and defaults, with a generic template and manual entry for anything not on the list. Imports are de-duplicated automatically, resolve fills into trades (partials summed, sign-encoded direction handled), and land in a rolling 31-day import history where a whole import — and every trade it created — can be rolled back in one action. Trades export back out to CSV from the trades table, all of them or just the rows you select.
- **Tags & categories** — tags grouped into categories (e.g. _Setup type_, _Mistake_), assignable to trades and usable as filters.
- **Instrument-aware P&L across asset classes** — every trade carries an asset class (stocks, futures, forex, crypto, options, CFDs, other) and a value multiplier, so P&L and R are computed correctly per instrument. Pre-fill and built-in contract multiplier and tick size. The multiplier stays editable per execution.
- **Global filters** — app-wide header to switch accounts, pick a date range (with presets), toggle the unit between **$** and **R**, and apply filters across the P&L screens (dashboard, trades, statistics, strategies). Discipline is intentionally exempt — it tracks your process over the full calendar, not a filtered slice of trades.
- **Polished UX** — dark-first design with a light theme, responsive layout with a mobile navigation sheet, installable as a PWA, and consistent skeleton loading states throughout.

See [`docs/UX_UI.md`](docs/UX_UI.md) for a full UX/UI walkthrough of the screens, flows, and design system.

## Self-hosting (Docker)

The fastest way to run your own instance — app + PostgreSQL in two containers,
with database migrations applied automatically on start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HonzaPrikryl/tradenza.git
cd tradenza
cp .env.example .env    # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD + your Clerk keys
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign up. The only external service required is a free-tier [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application for auth. Prefer not to build locally? A prebuilt image is published to GHCR on every release (`ghcr.io/honzaprikryl/tradenza`). The full guide — prebuilt images, external databases, reverse proxy + HTTPS, backups, upgrades, multi-replica migrations — lives in [`docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

Every release is written up in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), including anything self-hosters have to do when upgrading. Worth a look before you pull a new image.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and npm
- A **PostgreSQL** database — local (e.g. Docker), Neon free tier, or any other Postgres
- A **Clerk** application for authentication — free tier is plenty

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HonzaPrikryl/tradenza.git
cd tradenza
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The only **required** variables are the database URL and the Clerk keys; everything else is optional and unlocks extra features (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)).

For local development use your **Clerk _Development_ instance** keys (`pk_test_…` / `sk_test_…`) — production (live) keys are locked to the production domain and error on `localhost`. See [Environments](#environments) for the full local/preview/production split.

### 3. Set up the database

Apply the versioned migrations to your database:

```bash
npm run db:migrate   # apply migrations in drizzle/ → DB
npm run db:studio    # (optional) open Drizzle Studio to inspect data
```

On a **fresh, empty** database this runs `drizzle/0000_baseline.sql` and builds the full schema. On an **existing** database (already populated) do the one-time baseline adoption first — see [Database & migrations](#database--migrations).

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign up, and you're in.

## Market data & charts

The candle chart on the trade detail page — the one that plots your entries and exits against real price — is **optional and asset-class dependent**. Everything else in the app works without it; a trade with no chart still journals, scores and reports normally.

Which historical source a trade is routed to is decided by its asset class in [`src/lib/market-data.ts`](src/lib/market-data.ts):

| Asset class | Chart | Source                                            | Key required           |
| ----------- | :---: | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Futures** |  ✅   | Databento `GLBX.MDP3`, the contract you traded    | `DATABENTO_API_KEY`    |
| **Stocks**  |  ✅   | Databento equities (`DATABENTO_EQUITIES_DATASET`) | `DATABENTO_API_KEY`    |
| **Forex**   |  ✅   | Polygon.io currency aggregates (`C:EURUSD`)       | `POLYGON_API_KEY`      |
| **Crypto**  |  ✅   | Binance spot klines (`BTCUSD` → `BTCUSDT`)        | **none** — works as-is |
| **Options** |  ❌   | No wired source                                   | —                      |
| **CFDs**    |  ❌   | No wired source                                   | —                      |
| **Other**   |  ❌   | No wired source                                   | —                      |

**Options, CFDs and "other" have no chart at all** — no provider is wired up for them, and the app says so in place of the chart rather than failing silently. This is the single most common reason a chart is missing.

Beyond asset class, a chart is also withheld when:

- **The trade was entered today.** Historical feeds only cover completed days, so the chart appears the next day.
- **The provider's key is missing** for that asset class — e.g. futures charts stay off until `DATABENTO_API_KEY` is set. Crypto is the exception and needs no key.
- **The symbol doesn't resolve** — forex only charts when the symbol parses as a currency pair (`EURUSD`, `EUR/USD`); a stock outside your configured equities dataset returns no data. The default `XNAS.ITCH` carries what executed **on Nasdaq**, which for a NYSE-listed ticker is a slice of the tape rather than nothing — prices track the consolidated ones, volume doesn't. Set `DATABENTO_EQUITIES_DATASET=EQUS.MINI` for consolidated US coverage.
- **The per-user candle rate limit** (10/min · 100/day) is hit, when rate limiting is enabled.

Two things on the detail page are **derived from candles** and therefore disappear together with the chart: the **MAE/MFE** excursion figures and the candle-based **running P&L** curve. Your entered prices, P&L, R-multiple and every statistic that builds on them are computed from the trade itself and are never affected.

Candles are cached in the database and the cache is **shared across all users**: the same instrument and interval is identical for everyone, so a span fetched once serves every account. Storage is one row per fixed time chunk (`market_candle_chunks`, see [`src/lib/candle-cache.ts`](src/lib/candle-cache.ts)) rather than one "covered range" per instrument — a chunk row holds exactly what the provider returned for its span, so the cache can never claim coverage it doesn't have. Chunks whose span is finished and non-empty are kept forever; empty or still-forming ones carry a TTL and are re-fetched, so a weekend, a provider blip or a symbol that isn't listed yet heals itself instead of turning into a permanent "no market data". Provider responses are paged through to the end of the requested range, since every provider caps rows per response and a truncated answer is indistinguishable from a short one.

**Futures pick the contract you actually traded.** A symbol that names its expiry (`NQU6`) charts that contract directly. A bare root (`NQ`) starts from the continuous front month; if the trade filled at a price that series never traded at, one daily-bar request across every listed expiry of the root identifies the contract that did trade there — the busiest one, since a thin far-dated month can span a price the market never met. That is what makes charts around a roll line up, because volume moves to the new expiry days before the continuous series does, and it works for a deliberately far-dated contract just as well. If no expiry traded at that price, the front month is charted rather than nothing.

Roots are routed to the venue that lists them — CME Globex for most, ICE for the softs (cotton, sugar, coffee, cocoa, orange juice), Cboe for VIX. `node --env-file=.env.local scripts/check-market-feeds.mjs` smoke-tests every provider against the live APIs.

## Rate limiting

Per-user rate limiting is **optional**, via [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com). When `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are unset it is disabled and the app behaves normally. To enable it, create a database in the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com) and add its REST URL + token to your environment (Upstash's free tier is more than enough).

Only write actions are limited; browsing and reading are never throttled. If someone goes too fast, the action is held back and a friendly countdown tells them when to try again. If Redis is ever unreachable, requests are allowed through rather than blocked.

| Action                   | Limit (per user)     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Candle charts            | 10 / min · 100 / day |
| CSV / manual import      | 5 / min              |
| Create / update / delete | 60 / min             |

## Analytics

Product analytics is **optional** and privacy-respecting, via [PostHog](https://posthog.com) on its **EU** cloud. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is unset it is disabled and nothing is loaded. To enable it, create a project in the PostHog EU region and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` (host defaults to `https://eu.i.posthog.com`).

It is deliberately minimal and cookieless: `persistence: 'memory'` (no cookies → no consent banner), autocapture and session recording are **off** (we never capture DOM text/inputs, which for a trading app could be financial data), and only a small set of meaningful product events is sent.

## Account & data deletion

Users can permanently delete their account and all associated data from **Settings → Global settings → Delete account** (trades, journal, tags, accounts, discipline history, and uploaded images).

## Environments

The app runs in three isolated environments. Each service provides its own separation, so local testing never touches production data or users.

| Layer          | Loaded from                                                          | Clerk                              | Database                  | Domain split                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local**      | `.env.development` (committed) + `.env.local` (secrets, git-ignored) | Development instance (`pk_test_…`) | `dev` branch              | Off — everything on `http://localhost:3000`              |
| **Preview**    | Host dashboard → Preview env                                         | Development instance               | `dev` (or preview) branch | Off / per-branch URL                                     |
| **Production** | Host dashboard → Production env                                      | Production instance (`pk_live_…`)  | main branch               | On — `tradenza.dev` (landing) + `app.tradenza.dev` (app) |

How the separation works:

- **Auth (Clerk)** — Clerk ships two instances. The **Development** instance works on `localhost`; the **Production** instance is locked to the production domain. Use the matching key pair per environment.
- **Database** — use a separate database per environment so local writes never touch production data. With any standard Postgres that's simply a second database — e.g. the local container from `docker-compose.yml` (`docker compose up -d db`). On Neon (which the hosted instance uses) the same is done with a **branch** (`Neon → Branches → dev`); either way, put that connection string in `.env.local`.
- **Domain routing** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_URL` drive the host split in `middleware.ts`. They are **empty locally** (single host, no redirects) and set to the real domains only in the Production environment.

Local secrets live in `.env.local` (never committed). Production and preview values are set in your host's dashboard (e.g. Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables), scoped to the matching environment. The committed `.env.development` only pins non-secret defaults (the domain split stays off locally).

## Database & migrations

The project uses **versioned migrations** (`drizzle-kit generate` + `migrate`). `db:push` is **not** used — on this database it errors with `42P16` because push tries to regenerate a primary key on a full-schema diff.

Everyday workflow:

```bash
# 1) edit src/lib/db/schema.ts
npm run db:generate -- --name my_change   # writes drizzle/000X_my_change.sql + meta snapshot
# 2) review & commit the generated SQL, then:
npm run db:migrate                         # applies pending migrations, records them in drizzle.__drizzle_migrations
```

Migrations are applied per environment by running `db:migrate` with that environment's `DATABASE_URL` (local dev DB, then production — see [Deployment](#deployment)).

Adopting migrations on an **existing** database (already has the tables but no migration journal) needs a **one-time baseline seed** so `migrate` doesn't try to recreate existing tables. The full procedure — including the production step — is documented in [`drizzle/MIGRATIONS.md`](drizzle/MIGRATIONS.md).

### Schema overview

| Table                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`                                      | User records synced from Clerk (email, name) — used by admin & data purge                                                   |
| `accounts`                                   | Trading accounts (prop-firm model: firm, phase, size, currency)                                                             |

## Importing trades

1. Export a CSV from your broker.
2. In Tradenza go to **Add trade** and start the wizard with **Add new account**, or select an existing account to which you want to add trades.
3. Follow the four steps — **Broker → Account → Method → Trades**: pick your broker, prop firm or platform, create the trading account the trades belong to, choose file upload or manual entry, then drop the CSV (picking its time zone).
4. Confirm — duplicates are detected and skipped automatically, and the result is recorded in your import history.

Manual single-trade entry is the same wizard with **Add manually** as the method, and is also the fallback for brokers without a file template yet. Imports from the last 31 days are listed under **Settings → Import history**, where a whole import (and every trade it created) can be rolled back in one action. Trades go back out as CSV from the **Trades** table — the whole table, or just the rows you tick.

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

```bash
npx vercel
```

Add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, then apply migrations to your production database with `db:migrate` pointed at the production `DATABASE_URL` (`vercel env pull`, then `dotenv -e .env.production.local -- npm run db:migrate`). Adopting an already-populated production DB requires the one-time baseline seed in [`drizzle/MIGRATIONS.md`](drizzle/MIGRATIONS.md) first. The app is a standard Next.js project and will run on any platform that supports Next.js 15 (Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, …). For a Docker/VPS deployment use the bundled `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` — see [Self-hosting](#self-hosting-docker) and [`docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

A strict, nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** is enforced per request in `src/middleware.ts` (production drops `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` in favour of a per-request nonce + `strict-dynamic`). If you add a third-party script or origin, extend the allow-list in `src/lib/csp.ts`.

### Backups & monitoring

The production database is the only irreplaceable state. Set up point-in-time recovery where your provider offers it (e.g. Neon history) plus scheduled **off-provider logical dumps** — the scheduled `DB Backup` workflow (`.github/workflows/db-backup.yml`) and full recovery steps are documented in [`docs/BACKUPS.md`](docs/BACKUPS.md). Docker self-hosts have a one-line `pg_dump` recipe in [`docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

A public **health check** lives at `/api/health` (returns `200` with `"status":"ok"` when the app can reach its database, `503` otherwise). Point an uptime monitor (UptimeRobot, Better Stack, …) at it, or use the bundled `Uptime` workflow (`.github/workflows/uptime.yml`). To report a security issue, see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev            # start the dev server
npm run build          # production build
npm run lint           # ESLint
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run test           # Vitest (watch)
npm run test:run       # Vitest (CI)
npm run test:coverage  # coverage report
npm run format         # Prettier --write
```

Git hooks (Husky + lint-staged) format and lint staged files on commit, and CI re-runs Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, and the unit tests on every push and pull request. The pure domain logic is covered by Vitest unit tests living alongside the modules they cover (mostly in `src/lib`): statistics, P&L, futures & forex instrument sizing, MAE/MFE, R-multiple, breakeven, discipline scoring and rule schedules, CSV column mapping and broker templates, date/timezone handling, validation and rate limiting.
